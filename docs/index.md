### Canvas structure

*   The Syllabus/PM centralizes the most relevant information
*   Modules/Home provides a quick link to lecture material, (mandatory) home and (optional) bonus assignments.
*   You can use the [Discussions](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/36823/discussion_topics) part on Canvas to ask questions, it provides the possibility to ask questions anonymously and to find a partner for assignments. Please respect Chalmers' rules and basic courtesy when interacting on the forum (StackOverflow [Code of Conduct Links to an external site.](https://stackoverflow.com/conduct) provides a good baseline of how one should behave).
*   Assignments **are not handled** in Canvas, please register to [Fire](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/36823/pages/submitting-assignments "Submitting Assignments") instead. Fire is a self-hosted solution to manage grading, you can find more information following the link aforementioned.

### Course purpose

The purpose of the course is to give an overview of cryptographic primitives, protocols and applications.

### Schedule

[TimeEdit Links to an external site.](https://cloud.timeedit.net/chalmers/web/public/s.html?sid=3&object=course_TDA352&type=course&p=0.m%2C2.w)

### Course literature

There is plenty of material freely available online about 'introduction to cryptography'.

We will use two main resources: [An Intensive Introduction to Cryptography Links to an external site.](https://intensecrypto.org/public/) by B. Barak; and [A Course in Cryptography Links to an external site.](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4830/2010fa/lecnotes.pdf), by Pass and Shelat

[This page](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/36823/pages/literature-overview "Literature Overview") provides an overview of the chapters used in the course, organized by module/lectures.

We are also developing lectures notes.

### Course design

The main learning activities in the course are: **lectures** (**Tuesdays** and **Fridays** 10:00-11:45), **exercise sessions** (**Fridays** 15:15-17:00 from course week 1). Lectures and exercise sessions take place on campus in physical form and will not be recorded or zoomed. 

We offer **office hours** to directly address questions on exercises and home assignments. They usually run on **Wednesdays** **12:00-13:00 in EDIT 6128** (see Course Summary below for further details).

The course is organized in **3 modules**. Each module lasts about 2 weeks and contains 4 lectures, 2 exercise sessions, and 1 mandatory home assignment (see details next). An additional recap lecture concludes the course. There are a number of optional bonus assignments to obtain extra points that count towards the final grade (see details next).

There are three **mandatory** **home assignments** for which students receive supervision and feedback on. Each mandatory assignment has a strict deadline. Students must hand in a, **possibly incomplete,** solution before the deadline. After receiving feedback from graders, you should submit an improved solution. We expect most student to pass at the second or third attempt. A maximum of 5 regrading for each Home Assignment is allowed, mind that graders need time to assess your resubmission so try to follow the recommended resubmission deadlines. The final deadline for submitting the last attempt for home assignment is **January 11th**. This deadline is **FIRM.**

The home assignments can be handed out **in group of two people, or alone**. You can change group for each assignment, but **not for the resubmission of the same home assignment**. The management of groups is done through Fire as explained [here](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/36823/pages/submitting-assignments "Submitting Assignments"). You can choose your group until the deadline. We recommend using the [Discussions](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/36823/discussion_topics) to pick a partner.  

In order to access the **course material**, you need to **pass** the [Checkpoint Quiz](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/36823/assignments/115251 "Pass this "Checkpoint Quiz" to unlock access to the course material ") (unlimited re-takes). This is done to  to avoid confusions and make sure every students understands the general course info and structure.

There are 3 **bonus assignments** (1 per module), these are **not mandatory,** **individual** (discussing in groups is great, but each person needs to submit a different solution), and allow a **single submission attempt**. Passing one bonus assignments results in **+1 additional point added to your exam score** (see the concrete formula in the "Examination form" section), if the exam is taken in the **same academic year**. A maximum of 3 points can be collected through bonus assignments.  Bonus assignments are designed for the fun of learning and digging into topics that branch out from the content of the lectures. They require some original thinking and provide you an opportunity to have hands-on experience with some cryptographic libraries. They are (hopefully) rewarding to solve, and give you extra points for the final grade, but they do _not include any material that will give you a considerable advantage in writing a good exam_.

### Changes made since the last occasion

New time slot for exercise sessions, revised exercise sheets and sessions.

Discussions now happen on Canvas. 

### Learning objectives and syllabus

Learning objectives:

*   *   Well-established cryptosystems
    *   Core principles behind provable security and constructive cryptography
    *   Goals and design principles for several cryptographic primitives and proof system 
    *   Identify, analyze and explain various forms of attacks based on improper usage of cryptographic primitives, modes of operation, or protocols
    *   Rigorous proofs of security

Examination form

The examination has three components (two mandatory, one optional):

*   A written, closed-book exam with only a (rarely necessary) calculator as aid.
*   Three home assignments.
*   Optional Bonus assignments (in form of report and/or coding).

**To pass the course the student must pass the exam and all three mandatory home assignments.** The grade is determined by the points collected in the exam, if these reach the passing threshold, then any points collected with passed bonus assignments are added (see the pseudocode formula below). The mandatory assignments do not count towards the final grade but are necessary in order to pass the course.

def final\_grade(exam\_points,bonus\_points):  
   if (exam\_points < 30):  
     return "not pass"  
   else:  
     tot\_points = exam\_points + bonus\_points  
     if (tot\_points < 40):  
        return "grade 3"   
     if (tot\_points < 47):  
        return "grade 4"   
   return "grade 5" 

The exam provides 0-60 points, and bonus assignments provide 0-3 points.
